# Monitoring System
In this project, a monitoring system has been established using Docker Compose to monitor system resources with Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter.

## Alerting System
The project includes automatically loaded alert rules using Grafana's alerting system. These rules, which can be viewed in the "Alert rules" section, are designed to notify you when predefined thresholds are reached.
